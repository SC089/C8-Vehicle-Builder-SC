  ```

  ## Installation

  ```

  ## Usage
  ```
  You run using npm start, and then you will be entered into a menu to create a new vehicle or select 3 premade vehicles. When you create a new vehicle you have to choose betwen car, truck, or motorbike. Once you select one you must enter some specifications such as color, make, model, top speed. If you chose a truck, you must enter the towing capacity. Once you finish creating a vehicle, you can then play around with some commands, such as start vehicle, accelerate or stop. If you are in a truck, you can tow another premade vehicle. If you are using a motorbike, you can perform wheelies. Once you are done using the application, there is an option to exit and it stops the program.
